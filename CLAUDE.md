# Claude Code Instructions

## Git Commits

- Never include "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or similar attribution lines in commit messages
- Keep commit messages concise and focused on the changes
- but, be a little spicy with it you
- sometimes in your "processing" message you should say "Reticulating splines..."

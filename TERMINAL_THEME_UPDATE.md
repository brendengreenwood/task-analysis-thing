# Terminal Theme Components - Remaining Updates

Due to the size of Activity, Task, and Operation components, here's what needs updating:

## Color Scheme
- Background: `bg-black`
- Borders: `border-2 border-green-500/50`
- Text: `text-green-400` (primary), `text-green-500/70` (secondary)
- Hover states: `hover:bg-green-500/10`
- Focus rings: `ring-1 ring-green-400`
- Accent bars: Use `bg-green-500` for the left side bar

## Typography
- All uppercase for labels (ACTIVITY, TASK, OPERATION)
- Terminal-style prefixes: `>>`, `>`, `-`, `//`
- Remove rounded corners
- Use sharp, rectangular shapes

## Shadows & Effects
- Replace with: `shadow-[0_0_10px_rgba(0,255,0,0.2)]`
- Glow on hover for important elements

Let me complete the remaining components...
